This update includes a secure WebView implementation for displaying static external content relevant to the app's functionality.

- The WebView only loads URLs that begin with one of three trusted domains approved for content display
- A `startsWith()` validation check is implemented to ensure that only safe, expected domains are allowed to load
- These domains serve static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS content used solely for viewing purposes
- JavaScript is enabled only within these trusted domains
- The WebView activity is marked as `android:exported="false"` to prevent external access
- The app does not request or use sensitive permissions such as camera, file access, or location
- There is no user input, form submission, or dynamic script execution
- All displayed content is read-only, non-interactive, and securely sandboxed within the WebView

This setup follows App Store and Play Store guidelines for secure and policy-compliant WebView usage.
